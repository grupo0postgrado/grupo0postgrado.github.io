                <p>The purpose of this research is to predict the percentage of free docks based on the historical
                    data from each <a href="https://www.bicing.barcelona/">Bicing</a> station, a bicycle-sharing system
                    in Barcelona, Spain.</p>

                <p>The data used for the prediction was obtained from <a
                        href="https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/">Open Data BCN</a>, providing information on
                    the number of bicycles and available docks per station between 2020 and 2023. Additionally,
                    station-specific information such as the total number of docks and their coordinates was included
                    from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MRBWDKh6D5773FfoJYv6vHKBCC1TasVO/view">this file</a>.

                <p>The project used Python for development, emphasizing the handling of large datasets with <a
                        href="https://www.dask.org/">Dask</a>. Dask was selected for its capability to process data
                    larger than available memory by parallelizing operations across multiple cores or distributed
                    computing clusters, providing substantial performance benefits over traditional tools like pandas.
                </p>
                <p>Firstly, a Dask DataFrame was created by concatenating raw records from all available months of data,
                    spanning from January 2020 to December 2023. Below are the initial records from this DataFrame:</p>

                <p>Next, the records were filtered to keep only the stations in service, and data transformation
                    began.</p>
                <p>Initially, the data was processed year by year, identifying discrepancies where records within a year
                    did not correspond to the year being processed, which led to their exclusion. Subsequently, the hour
                    from the <i>'last_reported'</i> column was extracted, and the percentage of free docks
                    (<i>'pct_free_docks'</i>) was computed using the columns <i>'num_docks_available'</i> and <i>'num_bikes_available'</i>.
                    This resulted in a new dataframe where data was grouped to calculate the average free docks per
                    station-hour.</p>
                <p>Finally, fields for the percentage of free docks from each of the previous 4 hours per record were
                    added, along with date-related columns formatted to match the required output format for prediction.
                    This process generated a file for each year in the format <i>{year}_processed_file.csv</i> with
                    processed data, as shown below:</p>

                <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they
                    set eye on the earth.</p>

                <h3 class="section-heading" id="explore">Exploration</h3>
                <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no
                    turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from
                    science.</p>

                <h3 class="section-heading" id="prediction">Prediction</h3>
                <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her
                    protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could
                    not help but love and cherish her.</p>

                <h3 class="section-heading" id="cases">Study Cases</h3>
                <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who
                    will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world
                    are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

                <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it
                    is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the
                    thrill of just beginning.</p>

                <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not
                    yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next
                    ten.

                <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a
                    historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human
                    development.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

                <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally, it shrank to the size
                    of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so
                    fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing
                    this has to change a man.</p>

                <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission:
                    to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man
                    has gone before.</p>

                <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental
                    truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
